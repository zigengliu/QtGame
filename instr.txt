Instruction for the Duck Runner!

	Hi player, my name is Runner, I am a duck. I have been traveling for a while and
I am worried about my egg. Please help me get to my egg.

Control: W, A , S, D for four directional movement.
Goal: get to the egg but don't let eagle catch me!
Rule: I am meat so I cannot go through walls. However, I can sneak into a hole for
	fast transportation. I have three brothers, if I die, they will continue with
	my mission, our mission. Protect our egg!
